# UTD CS6366 Computer Graphics

## Getting started
This repo shows an example of how to build a basic OpenGL program with NanoGUI. You can use this example as starting code for future assignments.

This code is suppose to be running on Windows x64 with VS 2019 (maybe VS 2017). For how to setup OpenGL environment on Windows x64 machine, please refers to the tutorial video on eLearning. Or you can checkout this [link](https://github.com/CS6366utd/environment_setup_windows).
